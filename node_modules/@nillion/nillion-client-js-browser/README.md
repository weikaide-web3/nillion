# Javascript Nillion Client

This javascript package provides programmatic access to the Nillion network, directly from the browser, using
a wrapped WASM package that, in addition to implementing Nillion algorithms, it connects directly to the libP2P
network using secure websockets. Consider that this library also makes use of browser web-workers.

⚠️ Be advised that this will cause the browser to enforce certain
CORS rules that can be allowed by setting the following server headers:

- Header: 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy'
  Value: 'require-corp'
- Header: 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy'
  Value: 'same-origin'
